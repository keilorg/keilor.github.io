		<p>From 2017-2020 I worked at <a href="https://visa.com/" class='link'>Visa</a> as a Chief of Staff,
      doing everything from Data Science to Sales Ops to Business Development. Before Visa, I built the risk model for
      <a class='link' href="https://www.commonbond.co/">Commonbond's</a> loan system, which helped students across the world get better rates on their loans.
		  In another life, I was a quantitative trader at <a class='link' href="https://sig.com/quantitative-trading/">Susquehanna International Group</a>,
      and I studied Math at Yale.

      <p>In 2020, I designed myself a data science bootcamp. You can see some of my projects below!</p>
