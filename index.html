		<p>I love using data to solve hard problems. I'm a team player and I get shit done ðŸ’ª</p>

		<p>From 2017-2020 I worked at <a href="https://visa.com/" class='link'>Visa</a> as a Chief of Staff,
      doing everything from Sales Ops to Data Science to org strategy. Before Visa, I build the risk model for
      Commonbond's loan system, which helped get better rates for students across the world.
		  In another life, I was a desk trader at <a class='link' href="https://twitter.com/hfa">Susquehanna International Group</a>,
      and I studied Math at Yale.

      <p>In 2020, I designed myself a data science bootcamp. You can see some of my projects below!</p>
