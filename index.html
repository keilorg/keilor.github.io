		<p>I love using data to solve hard problems. I'm a team player, and I get things done.</p>

		<p>From 2016-2020 I worked at <a href="https://visa.com/" class='link'>Visa</a> in Analytics and as a Chief of Staff,
      doing everything from Data Science to Sales Ops to Organizational Strategy. Before Visa, I built the underwriting and pricing models for
      <a class='link' href="https://www.commonbond.co/">CommonBond's</a> student loan products, helping thousands across the country afford higher education.
		  In another life, I was an options trader at <a class='link' href="https://sig.com/quantitative-trading/">Susquehanna International Group</a>,
      and I studied Math at Yale.

      <p>In 2020, I designed a data science bootcamp for myself. You can see some of my projects below!</p>

      <h3>Python</h3>

			<p>I explored defaults in LendingClubâ€™s historical loan data
				 and developed a strategy for using various tree-based models to mitigate investment loss.

        several technology and retail stocks and calculated the risk of investment.
